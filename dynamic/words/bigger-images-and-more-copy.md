## [Bigger Images and More Copy](/words/bigger-images-and-more-copy)

When Apple releases a new product, it's released with a product marketing page. It's interesting to watch the marketing pages, because usually they are either following a trend or starting one.

The iPhone 5 launch was no exception. After the announcements were over, I opened Safari and took at look at [apple.com/iphone/](http://apple.com/iphone/). The first thing I saw was a huge image of the phone (good) and a nice little block of copy. The copy was decently sized and readable, and there wasn't an overwhelming amount of it.

Naturally, I scrolled down. The next thing that grabbed my attention was the fact that the "infographic-y" numbers faded in and counted up to their stop. This isn't new, but it was done pretty well and it had a strong impact. When the numbers finished counting, my eye started to wonder to the only part I hadn't scanned (the left side), the copy.

My first thought was "man, that sure is a lot of copy". It was a weird feeling, because I don't typically feel that with Apple, simplicity and minimalism is usually their thing. As you scroll down the page it sorta goes in and out: overwhelming amount of copy, not so overwhelming amount of copy.

I thought it was interesting because I don't recall thinking that the iPhone 4 marketing page was overwhelmed with copy, so I decided to go way back and see what the iPhone 4 marketing page looked like, and I found the results interesting.

The number one thing I picked up on was how dated the design felt, which is interesting because the designs aren't that old.

The second thing I noticed was that the visuals are consistently smaller and the copy is a lot less. I'm not a designer and I don't do marketing, but it's interesting to think about why this shift happened. Are the images bigger because those big beautiful images convert to more sales? Is the copy dense just to fill the negative space that is leftover by the larger images? Did they feel that the copy didn't need as much focus because of the flashy animations? Does it have anything to do with Steve being gone?

### The End

The iPhone 5 has been out about a month now and I've had a chance to forget about the marketing pages. I came back to them today after starting this post and the funny thing was that I didn't notice the copy so much, mostly because I didn't even consider reading it. The page has so many other things going on that it didn't seem necessary... I was just enjoying the experience &mdash; consider that.
