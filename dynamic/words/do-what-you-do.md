## [Do What You Do](/words/do-what-you-do)

It's nice to be a Developer these days. We have things like [github](http://github.com), [pow](http://pow.cx), and [forward](https://forwardhq.com). There are various app stores that help us get paid for our work. It's nice.

As time goes on new software is introduced, new languages, and new programming concepts. As the development community grows, the amount of troublemakers grows as well. The guys that would rather tell you that you're using the wrong editor instead of answering your question, or how if you were using language "x" you wouldn't have the problem, or that you should be using tabs instead of spaces.

Development is becoming more and more like typical pop culture: editor of the week, language of the month, etc. 99% of the problems we are solving aren't new, or all that complex. You can solve those problems with any editor and most of the time you can solve those problems with any language. If you're constantly following the trend and using the new _hot_ framework or language, you're never truly mastering anything.

I think emacs is cool and I really wish I had the time to learn it, the same with vim. Right now I'm pretty decent at [TextMate](https://github.com/textmate/textmate), and there is a reason I haven't switched to emacs/vim/whatever. Because, I'm usually building things.

### productivity and scalability

I'm all for productivity, all for it, but not just because everyone else is saying I will be more productive with "x". I'm also all for speed and "scalability", but those are problems you can fix when you encounter them. Premature optimization can kill your development drive. You will not save time using the new hot database if you find out that it doesn't do everything you need it to do. And speed doesn't matter if you don't have a product to show.


### the end

Most of the time nobody cares what language you built your product in (and they damn sure don't care what editor you used), they just want the product. You have to maintain and update the product, just keep that in mind when you make your development decisions. It's easy to keep going when you have momentum, but it's hard to get started when you've stopped. It's hard to keep momentum up when you're not comfortable with your tools.
