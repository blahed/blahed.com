## Do What You Do

It feels pretty rad to be a developer these days. We have things like [github](http://github.com), [exceptional](http://www.getexceptional.com/), and various app stores that let us get paid.

Now, having said that, it sucks to be in the middle of the silly wars that go on about programming languages, frameworks, databases, and editors. Why do you give a fuck about what I use and why do I give a fuck about what you use? Also, why is development turning into pop music? Vim is hawt this month, so everybody blogs about switching to vim, and maybe emacs will be at the top of the charts next month.

I think emacs is cool and I wish I could murder code with it, but I can't. I do, however, happen to be pretty decent at Textmate, and do you know why I haven't found time to switch to emacs yet? Because, <span id='busy'>I'm busy building shit...</span> well, not really "shit", but "software".

It's 2010 fellas, we can build a house together. You can use your Stanley hammer and I can use my Kobalt. We might use a gas water heater, or maybe we'll use an electric. A real nice family will move into it and live happily ever after. Let's build a house together.

### tool reviews aren't so bad

Now having said all of that bullshit. I do happen to like a few of the tools that I use:

I work on a [mac](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/). I am a total fanboy, not because I think Apple can do no wrong, but because I think Apple, for the most part, actually cares about making damn fine products.

I use [textmate](http://macromates.com/) for editing, mostly because it was the first powerful editor that didn't make me feel like an idiot. I would love to learn more vim or emacs when I get some time (<a href="#" id='see-above'>see above</a>).

I program mostly in [ruby](http://tryruby.org/) and [python](http://www.python.org/). I tried to teach myself C++ when I was 12, then Java when I was 14, and I still don't know either of those. At some point in my life I read something about Ruby, I tried it, and I felt like a fucking smartypants, so I kept using it.

### so...

Just do what you do. Don't worry about what is hot this week. Build some of your own cool shit using whatever you know. The family isn't going to give a fuck what hammer was used to build the house, as long as the house is handsome.
