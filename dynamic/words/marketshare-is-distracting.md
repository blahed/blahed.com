## [Market Share is Distracting](/words/market-share-is-distracting)

The war of market share is a war that shouldn't exist when you're in the business of making good products. Market share doesn't mean you have a good product, just that a lot of people use your product.

A recent quote from Eric Schmidt struck me as odd and confusing.

>"This is a huge platform change; this is of the scale of 20 years ago -- Microsoft versus Apple. We're winning that war pretty clearly now"

He's talking about Android vs iOS, and it's odd for a few reasons, but mainly the simple comparison of Google/Android to Microsoft. Sure, Microsoft had the market share, and it still shows &mdash; Small Business and Enterprise are still dealing
with that "Market Share". Windows XP is still being used (it was released in 2001), and that is a failure of owning the market share, but not being able to produce a good product for it.

There are endless examples of products that have the market share but aren't particularly good products. Programmable thermostats before [nest](http://nest.com) were awful, and vacuum
cleaners that aren't [Dyson](http://www.dyson.com) have been relatively unchanged over the years. The Toyota Camry was the best selling car in 2011, does
that mean it's a better car than a BMW? Not necessarily, but it doesn't mean the Camry is a bad car either.

Maybe it's just Eric being a businessman and trying to please the shareholders, but the last thing I want to hear from a company that builds products is talk about "Market Share". Sure, you've got the market share &mdash; you allow Android to be installed on any mobile device that will turn on, and the major carriers can give Android phones away for free; we've seen how that goes. Now that I think about it, maybe it is a lot like the Microsoft vs Apple thing 20 years ago, and Eric you're kinda like Ballmer.

The companies that I respect are those that realize that they are building products first and they make that clear. Danke, to you all: Apple, nest, Dyson, 37signals.
