## New Years Resolutions (ain't shit)

So it's a new year and everyone has been talking about resolutions. Personally, I'd rather rant about why resolutions are real stupid... So here goes.

What the fuck!??!?! What is the point in waiting until January to start working on your flaws or tackling something new? Furthermore, why wait until the following January to tally up your points and see how you did?

If an organization decided to wait a year before coming up with a big list of shit to fix, it would undoubtedly fail, and for good reason, it just doesn't work. In my expert opinion, 80% of the resolutions that are made aren't followed through anyway, so why even make them?

I say, if you notice that you want to better yourself in some way, just do it. Don't put it off and pretend that you'll deal with it sometime in the next 12 months.

#### Here are three things that I've done this year: ####

1. Cleared my inboxes
2. Sorted out my desktop/productivity app situation
3. Wrote another blog post

#### Here are three things that I will do next: ####

1. Launch [justwondr.in](http://justwondr.in)
2. Start using S3 for backup
3. Write a blog post about my desktop/productivity app situation

Those are real things that I've done, and real things that I plan on doing. They aren't outstanding or reward worthy, but they are things that need to be done, so they go on a list.

If at some point I decide that I need to exercise more or stop eating candy, I'll do it right then. Why wait for January?

Now, you should go do something right away.
