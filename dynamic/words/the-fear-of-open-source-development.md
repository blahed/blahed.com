## [The Fear of Open Source Development](/words/the-fear-of-open-source-development)

It's been a little weird in the dev community lately. Sam Stephenson wrote a great essay [You Are Not Your Code](http://sstephenson.us/posts/you-are-not-your-code) which received one of two reactions: "this makes me feel better about my code" or "this is encouraging bad code".

The first group are the guys that have written code or built a project that has had support from the community and then lost it for whatever reason. Maybe the "style" of code is not considered best practice anymore, maybe the project just went stale because the developer couldn't put enough time into it, maybe something better just came along. The point is, those guys have been there and can relate.

The second group of guys are the ones that have never had to deal with the problem at all. Most likely because they don't write bad code and they always stay on top of best practices &mdash; maybe they just don't open source any of their bad code or any code at all.

I would have never imagined that anyone could have taken the essay as a negative thing, but people are weird and I just kinda let it be.

Now, fast forward a few weeks &mdash; Heather Arthur posts this: [I had a bad experience yesterday with open source](http://harthur.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/771/). The summary being that she had written a script a while back to help her with a workflow. She decided to put it up on github and several people found it useful. It started getting mentions and she found out that a lot of people were trashing the project and the code itself.

I don't understand. You share something that you've taken the time to write and the only thing certain people can find to say is that it's shit. I never thought the dev community would need to take notes from a team sport, but how about some good ole fashioned sportsmanship, a.k.a. don't be a dick.

Fear is a powerful thing, and it's easy to just read these posts and respond with "stop being a baby, toughen up", and that's a fair response. However, I recently started working on new gem and thought I was ready to push it to github/publish the gem and I seriously had to consider if I'd done anything that someone else would consider shit and even "should I open source this".

It's like not wanting to ask a question in front of the class because you think the bullies are gonna make fun of you.

That's fear, and that is the worst place we can be as developers.
