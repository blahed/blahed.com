Why Blogging Sucks
------------------

Hi, i'm going to blog now. I have come to realize that the main reason it hasn't worked out until now is because blogging really kinda sucks...

First, it's difficult to find the time to collect thoughts and form a decent post. It's really easy to stick a short blurb and a link on twitter, but that isn't really content. I intend to post content here... code tags, bar graphs, and other cool shit.

Reason two is that I have yet to find a blogging platform that wasn't a pain in the ass. Usually you spend more time trying to get content up than you spend actually writing the content. The blog engines aren't flexible and it always felt like I needed a little more control than I had.

Now having said all of that, I think that I have found my happy medium of things I want to say and the process that I want to say it with. I'll be kicking it old school with a static website that will be generated using a tool i've been working on, [frank](http://github.com/blahed/frank).

Alright, here goes the blogging... (with comments disabled).
